# AI Video Generation from Text

This project demonstrates the process of generating AI-driven videos from textual prompts using the [InstantVideo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KingNish/Instant-Video) library developed by [KingNish](https://huggingface.co/KingNish) on Hugging Face. A notable advantage of this tool is the ability to create multiple videos without depleting credits.

## Overview

The objective of this assignment was to generate AI-based videos from textual descriptions. Utilizing the InstantVideo library, I transformed text prompts into dynamic visual content. To enhance the videos, background music was integrated using the FFMPEG library.

## Approach

### Input

- **Text Prompts:** Descriptive sentences provided to the InstantVideo library to guide video generation.

### Output

- **Generated Videos:** Visual representations corresponding to the provided text prompts.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Text Prompt Submission:** Input descriptive text into the InstantVideo interface.
2. **Model Selection:** Choose the desired base model and motion settings within InstantVideo.
3. **Video Generation:** The library processes the text to produce a corresponding video.
4. **Audio Integration:** Download suitable background music from [Sound of Memes](https://soundofmemes.com) and merge it with the video using FFMPEG.

## Audio Integration

To enhance the generated videos, I incorporated background music:

1. **Music Selection:** Chose appropriate tracks from [Sound of Memes](https://soundofmemes.com).
2. **FFMPEG Utilization:** Employed the FFMPEG library to merge the selected audio with the generated video, ensuring synchronization and desired audio levels.

## Final Videos

The following videos were produced as the final output of this project:

- **bestop.mp4:** [Link to bestop.mp4](path_to_bestop.mp4)
- **finals2.mp4:** [Link to finals2.mp4](path_to_finals2.mp4)

## Advantages of InstantVideo

InstantVideo offers several benefits over other text-to-video generation tools:

- **Unlimited Usage:** Users can create multiple videos without worrying about exhausting credits, making it ideal for extensive projects.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The platform provides an intuitive interface, simplifying the video generation process for users of all technical levels.
- **Customization:** Offers various base models and motion settings, allowing for tailored video outputs based on user preferences.
